How to quickly copy paste to git bash cmd? 
>>some how I cannot find quick edit mode (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304372/how-do-you-copy-and-paste-into-git-bash) but shift+ins works for me so...

just copy from the ai03's guide
From Ruiqi Mao's PCB guide, here is a nice commands reference:
	1 m: pick the component up and move it
	2 g: drag the component up and move it while keeping wires attached to it
	3 c: copy the component
	4 e: edit the component
	5 r: rotate the component
	6 y: mirror the component
	7 del: delete the component
	8 esc: abort!
Also, these shortcuts are useful to know:
	1 w - Begin drawing a wire connection
	2 k - Cut a wire and stop drawing it without clicking on an endpoint
	3 Ctrl + h - Place a global net
